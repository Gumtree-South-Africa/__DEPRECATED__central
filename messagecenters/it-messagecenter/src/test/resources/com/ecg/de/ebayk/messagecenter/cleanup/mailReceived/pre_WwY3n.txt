Hi as long as he had a play mate I think he be fine. He is with my 15 year old foxy all day outside. He is just a barker. He loves to play with her and has never gotten out so as long as you have a fenced yard I think he be fine. I do have someone wanting to come and see him so I will let you know if he goes.
