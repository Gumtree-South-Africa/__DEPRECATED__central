Hello Ralph

 

We know it is the head gasket and not a corroded head because we had a roadworthy check on it (although not mandatory in SA) prior to putting it up on Gumtree.  We drove it to Kingston and back recently without any issues so I think you would be able to drive it to Adelaide (especially with your knowledge and skills).

 

Attached are some photos of the bodywork. As mentioned in the ad, there are some rust spots and it could do with a little TLC!!!

 

Feel free to call me on 0418829347 if you would like to discuss further.

 

Cheers
