This message has been sent through Gumtree mail, which keeps your email address private. We recommend that you always reply via Gumtree messenger instead of private email addresses. If there is anything about the message that you think is suspicious, do not reply and make sure to report it to us. We want to look out for you so we look into all reports and get back to you asap.

To make sure you have the best experience with us, here are a few top safety tips when buying and selling on Gumtree:

Try to meet face to face to have a look at the item you are buying and check the payment you are receiving
If you can't meet face to face use the PayPal 'Pay for goods and services' option to transfer money. This is covered by PayPal's Buyer Protection scheme.
Never click on links sent in an email or to login to Gumtree. These could be fraudulent so we always recommend to avoid - you should always access your account via the Gumtree homepage
Always check out our Stay Safe pages for more tips and latest safety info
